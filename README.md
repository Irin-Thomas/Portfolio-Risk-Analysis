# Portfolio Risk Analysis & Optimization

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores modern portfolio theory by analyzing the historical returns of five selected stocks. It includes return and volatility estimation, optimization using Solver, Sharpe ratio and Capital Market Line analysis, beta calculation, VaR estimation, and volatility modeling using GARCH in R.

✅ Completed as part of MSc Data Analytics coursework.

## 🔧 Tools & Methods
- Excel (Solver, correlation matrix, Sharpe, CML, beta, VaR)
- R (ARCH/GARCH modeling using `rugarch`)
- Yahoo Finance data (daily prices, 1+ year)
- Portfolio Theory, CAPM, Value at Risk, Efficient Frontier
